# MuMassCalculator
**A java library to Compute Compton, Raleigh, Photoelectric and Pair Production Cross sections**

MuMassCalculator is derived from the NIST XCOM web application used to calculate
photon cross sections for scattering, photoelectric absorption and pair production,
as well as total attenuation coefficients, for any element, compound (Z â‰¤ 100),
at energies from 1 keV to 100 GeV.

**Notes:**

Unlike XCOM, MuMassCalculator does not support mixtures.

MuMassCalculator was developed with JavaSE-1.8 (64-bit) and tested in the Eclipse IDE and as an ImageJ PlugIn with ImageJ 1.53k

MuMassCalculator has no ImageJ dependencies.

**Use:**

**_ImageJ_**

Put the MuMassCalculator Jar and to the ImageJ/plugins/jars folder.   
Put CT_Tool_Plugins.jar examples to the ImageJ/plugins folder.
Restart ImageJ.

**_Eclipse_**	put MuMassCalc_J8Lib.jar to your eclipse-workspace folder and add it to your project's buildpath.

An eclipse example class file


import jhd.MuMassCalculator.*;

	public class MuMassTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MuMassCalculator mmc = new MuMassCalculator();
		
		//get the tabulated photon energies for calcium carbonate between .001 and .1MeV
		double[] result = mmc.getMevArray("CA:1:C:1:O:3", .001, .1);		
		for(double mev : result)
		{
			System.out.println(mev);
		}
		
		//get the Total attenuation in cm2/gm for actinium at .1 MeV
		double theMuMass = mmc.getAtomMuMass("AC", .1, "Totattn");		
		System.out.println(theMuMass);
	}
